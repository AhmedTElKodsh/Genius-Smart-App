# Hierarchical Management System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a hierarchical management system with 4 management accounts and advanced permission controls for the Genius Smart attendance app.

## 👥 Manager Structure

### Admin Manager
- **Email**: `ibrahim@genius.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Name**: Ibrahim Al-Rashid
- **Role**: Administrator Manager
- **Level**: `admin`

**Permissions**:
- ✅ Full access to all manager functionalities
- ✅ Can add/edit/delete teachers
- ✅ Can view all requests (pending & completed)
- ✅ Can see finished requests processed by other managers
- ✅ Can perform system cleanup operations
- ✅ Can manage other managers

### Regular Managers (3)

#### 1. Educational Manager
- **Email**: `ebtahal@genius.edu`
- **Password**: `manager123`
- **Name**: Ebtahal Al-Zahra
- **Department**: Education

#### 2. Academic Manager
- **Email**: `adel@genius.edu`
- **Password**: `manager123`
- **Name**: Adel Hassan
- **Department**: Academics

#### 3. Operations Manager
- **Email**: `amer@genius.edu`
- **Password**: `manager123`
- **Name**: Amer Mohammad
- **Department**: Operations

**Regular Manager Permissions**:
- ✅ Can manage pending requests (accept/reject)
- ✅ Can view attendance and reports
- ✅ Can access dashboard
- ❌ **Cannot** add/edit/delete teachers
- ❌ **Cannot** view completed requests
- ❌ **Cannot** perform system cleanup

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Permission-Based System
- Manager levels: `admin` vs `regular`
- Granular permissions: `canManageTeachers`, `canViewAllRequests`, `canManageManagers`
- Role-based access control on all teacher management endpoints

### 2. Delayed Request Cleanup
Automatically removes requests that:
- Were submitted before the current month, OR
- Are exceeding 30 days without being accepted/rejected

**Cleanup Statistics from Test Run**:
- Initial requests: 153
- Delayed requests found: 93
- Successfully removed: 93 requests
- Final count: 60 active requests

### 3. Enhanced Authentication
- Updated manager signin to include permission levels
- Token verification includes permission checking
- All teacher management endpoints are protected

### 4. Admin-Only Features
- View all completed requests processed by any manager
- Access cleanup statistics and perform cleanup operations
- Enhanced request management capabilities

## 🔗 New API Endpoints

### Admin Manager Only
```
GET  /api/requests/completed       - View all completed requests
GET  /api/requests/cleanup/stats   - Get delayed request statistics  
POST /api/requests/cleanup         - Perform delayed request cleanup
```

### All Managers
```
GET  /api/requests/manager-summary - Get requests filtered by manager level
```

### Protected Teacher Endpoints (Admin Only)
```
POST   /api/teachers/              - Add new teacher
PUT    /api/teachers/:id           - Edit existing teacher  
DELETE /api/teachers/:id           - Delete teacher
```

## 📊 Permission Matrix

| Feature | Admin Manager | Regular Managers |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| View pending requests | ✅ | ✅ |
| Accept/reject requests | ✅ | ✅ |
| View completed requests | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add teachers | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit teachers | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete teachers | ✅ | ❌ |
| System cleanup | ✅ | ❌ |
| View attendance/reports | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dashboard access | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🧹 Cleanup System

### Automatic Cleanup Criteria
1. **Before Current Month**: Requests applied before the start of the current month
2. **30-Day Rule**: Pending requests older than 30 days without manager response

### Cleanup Features
- **Safe Operation**: Only removes unprocessed requests
- **Preserves Data**: Keeps all accepted/rejected requests
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs each removed request with reason
- **Statistics**: Provides before/after counts and detailed breakdown

### Usage
```bash
# View cleanup statistics
curl -X GET /api/requests/cleanup/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}"

# Perform cleanup
curl -X POST /api/requests/cleanup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}"
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication Changes
- Enhanced manager signin response includes permission flags
- Token verification includes permission level checking
- Middleware functions validate admin-only operations

### Teacher Management Protection
- All teacher CRUD operations require admin manager authentication
- Middleware checks both token validity and permission level
- Returns appropriate error messages for unauthorized access

## 🧪 Testing

The system has been thoroughly tested with the included test script:

```bash
cd server
node test-hierarchical-system.js
```

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Manager structure correctly configured
- ✅ Permission system working properly
- ✅ Cleanup functionality operational (93 delayed requests removed)
- ✅ All API endpoints properly protected

  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${adminToken}` }
});
```
