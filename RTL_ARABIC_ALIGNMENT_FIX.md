# RTL (Right-to-Left) Arabic Alignment Fix ✅

## Problem
In the Arabic version of the Settings page, text wasn't properly aligned from right to left, especially in the General tab sections.

## Solution
Added comprehensive RTL support to all components in the General tab by:

### 1. Updated Styled Components with RTL Support
All container components now accept `$isRTL` prop and apply appropriate styling:

#### Parent Containers:
- `FormContainer` - Added `direction: rtl`
- `FormHeader` - Added `direction: rtl`
- `FormTitle` - Added `text-align: right`
- `FormSubtitle` - Added `text-align: right`

#### Weekend Section:
- `WeekendSection` - Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right`
- `WeekendDays` - Added `direction: rtl`
- `DayCheckbox` - Already had RTL support

#### Holiday Section:
- `CalendarSection` - Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right`
- `CalendarWrapper` - Added `direction: rtl`
- `SelectedHolidaysSection` - Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right`
- `HolidayTagsContainer` - Added `direction: rtl`
- `HolidayTag` - Already had RTL support

#### Helper Components:
- `HelperText` - Added `text-align: right` and `direction: rtl`
- `Label` - Already had RTL support

### 2. Updated JSX to Pass RTL Props
All components now receive the `$isRTL={isRTL}` prop to ensure proper Arabic alignment.

### 3. Calendar RTL Features (Already Implemented)
- Arabic month names
- Reversed day headers (Saturday first)
- Reversed navigation buttons
- Arabic date formatting

## Result
Now in Arabic mode, all text elements properly:
- ✅ Start from the right side
- ✅ Align text to the right
- ✅ Flow from right to left
- ✅ Display checkboxes on the right side of labels
- ✅ Show calendar days in RTL order

## Technical Details
The `direction: rtl` CSS property ensures:
- Text flows from right to left
- Elements are positioned from right to left
- Proper bidirectional text handling

The `text-align: right` CSS property ensures:
- Text is aligned to the right edge
- Proper visual hierarchy in Arabic

## Testing
Switch to Arabic language and verify:
1. "إعدادات النظام" title aligns right
2. Section descriptions start from right
3. Checkbox labels are right-aligned
4. Calendar displays properly in RTL
5. Holiday tags align correctly
