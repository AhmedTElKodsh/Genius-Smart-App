# Employee Role Dropdown Implementation Complete

## Overview
Added Employee Role selection dropdown to both Edit Teacher and Add New Teacher modals as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Edit Teacher Modal (src/components/EditTeacherModal.tsx)
- Added a new "Employee Role" / "دور الموظف" dropdown above the Authorities section
- The dropdown shows three options:
  - Admin / مدير عام
  - Manager / مدير  
  - Employee / موظف
- The dropdown is connected to the existing `handleRoleChange` function which automatically updates authorities based on the selected role
- The selected role is saved to the server when the form is submitted

### 2. Add New Teacher Modal (src/components/AddTeacherModal.tsx)
- Added the same "Employee Role" / "دور الموظف" dropdown above the Authorities section
- Removed the old system role dropdown that was only visible to Admin users
- Made the new dropdown visible to all managers (not just admin)
- The dropdown uses the same three options and styling as the Edit Teacher Modal
- Connected to the existing `handleRoleChange` function for automatic authority updates

## Key Features

### Role-Based Authority Management
When a role is selected, the following authorities are automatically set:

**Admin Role:**
- Access Manager Portal ✓
- Access Teacher Portal ✓
- Add new teachers ✓
- Edit Existing Teachers ✓
- Delete Teachers ✓
- Accept and Reject All Requests ✓
- Download Reports ✓
- View All Analytics ✓
- Manage User Authorities ✓
- System Administration ✓

**Manager Role:**
- Access Manager Portal ✓
- Access Teacher Portal ✓
- View Teachers Info ✓
- Accept and Reject Employee Requests ✓
- Download Reports ✓
- View Analytics ✓
- Submit Own Requests ✓

**Employee Role:**
- Access Teacher Portal ✓
- Submit Requests ✓
- View Own Data ✓
- Check In/Out ✓

### Manual Authority Override
- The Authorities checkboxes remain visible and functional
- Managers can still manually adjust individual authorities after selecting a role
- This allows for custom permission configurations when needed

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow:
1. User selects a role from the dropdown
2. `handleRoleChange` function is called
3. Authorities are automatically updated based on the role
4. User can manually adjust authorities if needed
5. When saved, both `systemRole` and `authorities` are sent to the server
6. The server updates the teacher's role and permissions

### API Integration:
- Edit Teacher: PUT `/api/teachers/:id` includes `role: formData.systemRole`
- Add Teacher: POST `/api/teachers` includes `systemRole: formData.systemRole`

## User Experience
- The dropdown provides a quick way to assign standard role-based permissions
- Managers can easily assign roles without necessarily being in the Management department
- The system maintains flexibility by allowing manual authority adjustments
- Bilingual support with proper Arabic translations
