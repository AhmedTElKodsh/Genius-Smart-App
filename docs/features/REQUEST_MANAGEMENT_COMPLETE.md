# Request Management System Complete

## Overview
The request management system has been fully updated with the following features:

## Implemented Features

### 1. Database Update on Accept/Reject
- When a manager clicks Accept (موافقة) or Reject (رفض) and confirms:
  - The request status is updated in the database to 'approved' or 'rejected'
  - The request result is set to 'Accepted' or 'Rejected'
  - Approval tracking information is stored (approver ID, name, role, timestamp)

### 2. Balance Deduction for Accepted Requests
- **Late Arrival / Early Leave Requests**:
  - Hours are automatically deducted from teacher's `remainingLateEarlyHours`
  - System tracks granted hours and remaining balance
  - Success message shows deducted hours and remaining balance

- **Absence Requests**:
  - Days are calculated from the request duration
  - Days are deducted from teacher's `allowedAbsenceDays`
  - System tracks granted days and remaining balance
  - Success message shows deducted days and remaining balance

### 3. Request Removal from Lists
- After confirming Accept/Reject:
  - The request is immediately removed from the pending requests list in the UI
  - The request remains in the database with updated status for tracking
  - Teachers can still see their request status in notifications

### 4. Non-Admin Handled Requests (Admin Only)
- Replaced the "Delayed" section with "Requests Handled by Managers" for Admin users
- Shows a collapsible list of requests that were accepted/rejected by non-admin managers
- Groups requests by the manager who handled them
- Shows approval/rejection status and date
- Only visible to Admin managers

### 5. Teacher Notifications
- Teachers receive notifications when their requests are accepted or rejected
- Notifications appear on the Teacher's Notifications page
- Notifications show:
  - Request type (in both English and Arabic)
  - Whether it was accepted or rejected
  - Appropriate message in the selected language

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes
1. **Updated `/api/requests/:id` PUT endpoint**:
   - Calculates hours/days to deduct based on request type
   - Updates teacher balance in teachers.json
   - Stores granted hours/days in the request record
   - Returns remaining balance information

2. **Added `/api/requests/non-admin-handled` GET endpoint**:
   - Returns requests handled by non-admin managers
   - Groups by manager for easy display
   - Only accessible to Admin managers

3. **Enhanced `updateTeacherBalance` function**:
   - Returns success status and remaining balance
   - Properly updates both hours and days based on request type

### Frontend Changes
1. **ManagerRequests Component**:
   - Detects if user is Admin for special features
   - Shows appropriate success messages with balance info
   - Replaces "Delayed" with non-admin handled requests for Admin
   - Immediately removes requests from UI after action

2. **TeacherNotifications Component**:
   - Fetches request status notifications from correct endpoint
   - Displays notifications in appropriate language
