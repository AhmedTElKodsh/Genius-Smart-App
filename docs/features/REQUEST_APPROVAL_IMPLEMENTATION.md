# Request Approval System Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the enhanced request approval system with proper balance management, notifications, and UI improvements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication (✅ Completed)
- **Issue**: "فشل في قبول الطلب: Unauthorized: Invalid token"
- **Solution**: Updated `roleAuthMiddleware.js` to handle both JWT tokens (from manager signin) and legacy gse_ tokens
- **File**: `server/middleware/roleAuthMiddleware.js`

### 2. Enhanced Balance Management (✅ Completed)
- **Hours Deduction**: For Late Arrival and Early Leave requests
  - Deducts from `remainingLateEarlyHours`
  - Updates `usedLateEarlyHours`
- **Days Deduction**: For Absence and Authorized Absence requests
  - Updates `totalAbsenceDays`
  - Calculates `remainingAbsenceDays`
- **File**: `server/routes/requests.js` - `updateTeacherBalance` function

### 3. Custom Confirmation Dialog (✅ Completed)
- **Component**: `src/components/ConfirmationDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Beautiful gradient design for accept (green) and reject (red)
  - Shows request details (teacher, type, duration)
  - Warning message about balance deduction
  - Smooth animations
  - RTL/LTR support
- **Usage**: Integrated in `ManagerRequests.tsx`

### 4. Teacher Notifications (✅ Completed)
- **Backend Endpoint**: `GET /api/teachers/:id/notifications`
  - Returns processed requests with approval/rejection status
  - Includes approver name and timestamp
- **Frontend Integration**:
  - TeacherNotifications page fetches from new endpoint
  - TeacherTimerPage shows latest notification banner
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

### 5. Balance Update Endpoint (✅ Completed)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/teachers/:id/balance`
- **Returns**: Current balance status including:
  - `remainingLateEarlyHours`
  - `totalAbsenceDays`
  - `remainingAbsenceDays`

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Request Approval
1. Login as Manager (Admin):
   - Ibrahim Hamdy: ibrahimmizo55@gmail.com
   - Amer Zaher: badrsalah525@gmail.com
2. Go to Requests page
3. Click Accept/Reject on any request
4. Verify:
   - Custom confirmation dialog appears
   - Shows request details correctly
   - Success toast notification after action

### 2. Test Balance Deduction
1. Before approving a request, check teacher's balance:
   - Note the teacher's ID from the request
   - Check `server/data/teachers.json` for current balance
2. Approve a Late Arrival/Early Leave request
3. Check teacher's data again:
   - `remainingLateEarlyHours` should be reduced
   - `balanceLastUpdated` should be updated

### 3. Test Teacher Notifications
1. Login as the teacher whose request was approved/rejected
2. Check:
   - Notification page shows the request status
   - Timer page shows notification banner at top of Summary section
   - Banner can be dismissed by clicking X

### 4. Test Real-time Updates
1. Keep teacher portal open on Timer page
2. From manager portal, approve/reject a request for that teacher
3. Within 30 seconds, notification should appear in teacher's timer page

## File Changes Summary

### Backend
- `server/middleware/roleAuthMiddleware.js` - JWT token support
- `server/routes/requests.js` - Enhanced balance management
- `server/routes/teachers.js` - New notification and balance endpoints

### Frontend
- `src/components/ConfirmationDialog.tsx` - New component
- `src/pages/ManagerRequests.tsx` - Integrated confirmation dialog
- `src/pages/TeacherNotifications.tsx` - Updated to use new endpoint
- `src/pages/TeacherTimerPage.tsx` - Added notification banner

## Notes
- Email notifications are still sent as before (if email service is configured)
- Request history is preserved for audit trail
- Balance updates are atomic and logged with timestamps
- Notifications check for unread status to avoid showing old notifications
