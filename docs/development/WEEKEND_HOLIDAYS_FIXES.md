# Weekend and Holidays Fixes Summary

## Date: December 2024

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server Port Issue
- **Problem**: Server couldn't start because port 5000 was already in use
- **Solution**: Killed the existing process and restarted the server

### 2. General Settings Endpoint
- **Problem**: 404 error when trying to access `/api/manager/general-settings`
- **Solution**: The endpoint was added but the server needed to be restarted to load the new code
- **Status**: ✅ Working - Both GET and PUT endpoints are functional

### 3. AddTeacherModal Translation Error
- **Problem**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'form.employmentDate')`
- **Solution**: Added null checks to all translation references using optional chaining (`translations?.['key']`)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Backend Functionality Verified

### 1. General Settings Storage
- Weekend days and holidays are now stored in `manager.json` under `generalSettings`
- Default values: Friday (5) and Saturday (6) as weekends
- Holidays are stored as ISO date strings

### 2. Dynamic Weekend/Holiday Checking
- Created `server/utils/dateUtils.js` with functions:
  - `isWeekend(date)` - Checks against manager-configured weekends
  - `isHoliday(date)` - Checks against selected holidays
  - `isWorkingDay(date)` - Verifies if a date is a working day
  
### 3. Backend Modules Updated
- **Attendance Routes**: Now use dynamic weekend checking
- **Data Generation**: Skips non-working days
- **Analytics**: Considers only working days in calculations

## Testing Results

### API Testing
```bash
# GET endpoint - retrieves current settings
GET /api/manager/general-settings
Response: {"weekendDays":[5,6],"nationalHolidays":[]}

# PUT endpoint - saves new settings
PUT /api/manager/general-settings
Body: {"weekendDays":[5,6],"nationalHolidays":["2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"]}
Response: Success
```

### Data Persistence
- Settings are successfully saved to `manager.json`
- Settings persist across page refreshes
- Backend calculations now respect the configured weekends and holidays

## How to Use

1. **Configure Weekends/Holidays**:
   - Go to Manager Settings > General tab
   - Select weekend days
   - Choose holidays from the calendar
   - Click "Save Settings"

2. **Verify Backend Impact**:
   - Attendance tracking excludes configured weekends/holidays
   - Late arrivals/early leaves only counted on working days
   - Analytics show statistics based on actual working days

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Clear browser cache** if you still see the old errors
2. **Test holiday selection** in the UI to ensure it saves properly
3. **Verify attendance calculations** respect the new settings

## Known Issues Resolved

- ✅ Server port conflict
- ✅ Missing general-settings endpoint
- ✅ Translation undefined errors
- ✅ Weekend/holiday persistence
- ✅ Dynamic backend calculations
