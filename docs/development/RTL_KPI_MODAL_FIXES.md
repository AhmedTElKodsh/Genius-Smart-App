# RTL Text Alignment Fixes for KPI Modal Popups

## Date: December 2024

## Issue
Text in the KPI card popups was not properly aligned from right-to-left when viewing in Arabic mode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Styled Components for RTL Support

The following components were updated to support RTL text direction and alignment:

#### Content Component
- Added `isRTL` prop support
- Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right` for RTL mode

#### Description Component  
- Added `isRTL` prop support
- Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right` for RTL mode

#### TableTitle Component
- Added `isRTL` prop support
- Added `direction: rtl` and `text-align: right` for RTL mode

#### MetricCard, MetricValue, and MetricLabel Components
- Added `isRTL` prop support to all metric-related components
- Added `direction: rtl` for proper text flow

### 2. Updated Component Usage

All component instances were updated to pass the `isRTL` prop:
- `<Content isDarkMode={isDarkMode} isRTL={isRTL}>`
- `<Description isDarkMode={isDarkMode} isRTL={isRTL}>`
- `<TableTitle isDarkMode={isDarkMode} isRTL={isRTL}>`
- `<MetricCard key={index} isDarkMode={isDarkMode} isRTL={isRTL}>`
- `<MetricValue isDarkMode={isDarkMode} color={metric.color} isRTL={isRTL}>`
- `<MetricLabel isDarkMode={isDarkMode} isRTL={isRTL}>`

### 3. Components That Already Had RTL Support
The following components already had proper RTL support:
- ModalContent
- Header
- Title
- Table
- TableHeaderCell
- TableCell
- InsightItem

## Result
All text content in the KPI modal popups now properly aligns from right-to-left when viewing in Arabic mode, ensuring:
- Descriptions start from the far right
- Table titles align to the right
- Metric labels and values flow properly in RTL
- Consistent RTL text direction throughout the modal

## Testing
To test the changes:
1. Switch to Arabic language
2. Click on any KPI card in the Analytics page
3. Verify that all text starts from the right side
4. Check that numbers and percentages are displayed correctly in RTL context
