# Duplicate Declaration Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅

Successfully fixed the Babel/React compilation error related to duplicate identifier declarations in the ManagerSettings.tsx file.

## Problem Details

**Error**: `Identifier 'HolidayDate' has already been declared. (774:6)`

**Root Cause**: Two styled components with the same name `HolidayDate` were declared:
- Line 530: `const HolidayDate = styled.p` (for holiday management section)
- Line 774: `const HolidayDate = styled.div` (for enhanced holiday cards)

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Renamed Duplicate Component**
- Changed the second `HolidayDate` to `HolidayCardDate` (line 774)
- Updated corresponding usage in the enhanced holiday cards section (line 2011)

### 2. **Maintained Functionality**
- First `HolidayDate` (styled.p): Used in holiday management section for displaying holiday dates
- Renamed `HolidayCardDate` (styled.div): Used in enhanced holiday selection cards

## Files Modified

### `src/pages/ManagerSettings.tsx`
- **Line 774**: Renamed `HolidayDate` to `HolidayCardDate`
- **Line 2011**: Updated component usage from `<HolidayDate>` to `<HolidayCardDate>`

## Verification

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck` passes without errors
✅ **Development Server**: Starts without Babel parser errors
✅ **Component Functionality**: Both holiday display sections work correctly

## Impact

- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Clean Code**: Eliminated naming conflicts
- **Better Organization**: Clear distinction between holiday management and holiday selection components

## Translation Warnings Status

The Vite warnings about duplicate keys in translations.ts appear to be resolved as well:
- Only expected English and Arabic sections remain for each setting category
- No actual duplicate keys found in current file state

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Ready for development and testing
