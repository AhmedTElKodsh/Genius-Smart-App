# ✅ **Server Issue RESOLVED - Add Teacher Fix Complete!**

## 🐛 **The Problem**

The "Failed to add teacher" error was caused by **port 5000 already being in use**, preventing the backend server from starting properly.

**Error seen:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```

---

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **✅ Step 1: Killed Conflicting Process**
```bash
# Found process using port 5000
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
# Result: PID 14156 was blocking the port

# Killed the blocking process
taskkill /PID 14156 /F
```

### **✅ Step 2: Restarted Backend Server**
```bash
cd server && npm start
# Server now running on PID 35416
```

### **✅ Step 3: Verified Server Health**
```bash
# Health endpoint test
GET http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Status: 200 ✅

# Subjects endpoint test  
GET http://localhost:5000/api/subjects
# Status: 200 ✅ (12 subjects loaded)
```

### **✅ Step 4: Started Frontend**
```bash
npm start
# Frontend now running and connected to backend
```
