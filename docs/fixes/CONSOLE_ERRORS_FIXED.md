# Console Errors Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ Backend Server Connection (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Error:** `POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/manager/signin net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`

**Solution:** Started the backend server. It's now running on port 5000.

```bash
cd server && npm start
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Favicon Error (Minor - Exists)
**Error:** `Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: http://localhost:5173/favicon.svg`

**Status:** The favicon.svg file exists in the public directory. This error might be due to:
- Browser caching issues
- The SVG file format/content
- Manifest.json reference

This is a minor issue that doesn't affect functionality.

### 3. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Clerk Development Keys (Informational)
**Warning:** `Clerk has been loaded with development keys`

**Status:** This is expected in development. When deploying to production, you'll need to:
1. Get production keys from Clerk Dashboard
2. Update environment variables with production keys
3. Follow Clerk's deployment guide: https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/overview

### 4. üîå Browser Extension Errors (Not Our Code)
**Error:** Multiple `chatbot-finder.js: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: a is not iterable`

**Status:** These errors are from a browser extension (likely a chatbot finder extension), not from our application code. Users can:
- Disable the problematic extension
- Use incognito mode for testing
- Ignore these errors as they don't affect our app

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Application is now fully functional:**
- Frontend running on http://localhost:5173

The application should now work without critical errors!
