# Month Navigation Fix - Success Message Issue ✅

## Problem
The success confirmation message was appearing when clicking the month navigation buttons in the holiday calendar, not just when clicking "Save Settings".

## Root Cause
The month navigation buttons (`<` and `>`) were inside the form but didn't have an explicit `type` attribute. In HTML, buttons inside a form default to `type="submit"`, which causes them to submit the form when clicked.

## Solution
Added `type="button"` to both navigation buttons to prevent form submission:

```typescript
// Before
<button onClick={() => onMonthChange(...)}>
  {isRTL ? '›' : '‹'}
</button>

// After
<button type="button" onClick={() => onMonthChange(...)}>
  {isRTL ? '›' : '‹'}
</button>
```

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/ManagerSettings.tsx` - Added `type="button"` to both month navigation buttons

## Testing
Now the success message only appears when:
- ✅ Clicking "Save Settings" / "حفظ الإعدادات" button
- ❌ NOT when navigating between months
- ❌ NOT when selecting/deselecting holidays
- ❌ NOT when selecting/deselecting weekend days

## Technical Details
- The holiday remove buttons use `<span>` elements, so they don't cause form submission
- The weekend checkboxes are inputs, not buttons, so they don't cause form submission
- Only actual buttons inside forms need the `type="button"` attribute to prevent submission
