# Export Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. useLanguage Export Error in ClerkSignIn.tsx
- **Error**: `The requested module '/src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx' does not provide an export named 'useLanguage'`
- **Initial Cause**: Module resolution cache issue in Vite
- **Initial Fix Attempt**: Added explicit export for `LanguageProvider` at the end of LanguageContext.tsx
- **New Error**: `Multiple exports with the same name "LanguageProvider"`
- **Final Fix**: 
  - Removed the duplicate export of `LanguageProvider` (it was already exported when defined)
  - The `useLanguage` hook was already properly exported
  - The issue was Vite's HMR cache combined with the duplicate export

### 2. Favicon Download Error
- **Error**: `Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: http://localhost:5173/favicon.svg (Download error or resource isn't a valid image)`
- **Cause**: The favicon.svg file was corrupted or contained invalid/binary data
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Deleted the corrupted favicon.svg file
  - Created a new valid SVG favicon with a simple "G" logo on blue background
  - The new favicon matches the app's theme color (#007acc)

### 3. Duplicate Translation Keys Warning
- **Warning**: `Duplicate key "thisWeek" in object literal` and `Duplicate key "thisMonth" in object literal`
- **Cause**: Duplicate entries for `thisWeek` and `thisMonth` in the Arabic translations
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Removed duplicate entries on lines 493-497 in translations.ts
  - Kept the original entries that were already defined earlier in the file

## Steps Completed

1. Fixed the duplicate export of `LanguageProvider` in LanguageContext.tsx
2. Fixed duplicate translation keys in translations.ts
3. Killed all Node.js processes to ensure clean restart
4. Restarted the development server (`npm run dev`)

## Verification

After the server restarts, you should:
1. No longer see the `useLanguage` export error
2. No longer see the duplicate export error for `LanguageProvider`
3. No longer see duplicate key warnings for translations
4. See a blue square with white "G" as the favicon
5. No manifest icon errors in the console

## Additional Notes

- All exports in LanguageContext.tsx are now properly structured
- The translations file no longer has duplicate keys
- The development server is running on a fresh instance
- Clear browser cache if any issues persist
