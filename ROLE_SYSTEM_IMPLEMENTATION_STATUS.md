### Create Audit Trail UI for Admins
The backend audit trail system is working, but a UI needs to be created for Admins to view:
- List of all manager actions on requests
- Filter by date range, manager, action type
- Show request details and who approved/rejected
- Option to revoke manager decisions

## Testing Instructions

   - Confirm no timer/hours submission in Teacher portal

2. **Test Manager Access:**
   - Login as Mahetab Mostafa or any manager

   - Check ability to approve/reject teacher requests
   - Confirm timer and hours submission work in Teacher portal

3. **Test Employee Access:**

4. **Test Request Approval Tracking:**

## Next Steps
